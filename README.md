### Tutorial On Tensorflow
-----

<span> 
<p>Since we will be using tensorflow to build our model we will provide some tutorials and tips on tensorflow.
We will first discuss a general description of the tensorflow mechanism and paradigms- which might defy a little bit from common mainstream programming languages. After this  we proceed to build  <b> Neural network models</b> . Since we can't build a good model without good data analysis, we will provide a quick recap of useful <b>exploratory data analysis</b> techniques.</p>
<p>
<b>How to use the Tutorials: </b>
The tutorials will follow a sequential order. From the simple tensorflow hello word example,  to  simple calculations and then finally to building a  model. Lastly we will add ways to optimize a general neural models. Each tutorial consist of IPython notebook numbered in order in which it is to be studied - from simple to fairly difficult concepts.
